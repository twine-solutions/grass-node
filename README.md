## Features
- Identified as Desktop Node (2X points).

## Setup
1. Visit [Grass](https://getgrass.io/) and register an account.
2. Press F12 on the Dashboard page and go to the Console tab.
3. Paste the following script into the console and copy the value.
    ```js 
    const userId = localStorage.getItem('userId');

    if (userId) {
        console.log('Your user ID:', userId);
    } else {
        console.log('Failed to get userId');
    }
   ```
4. Your user ID should look like this: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. Do not copy the quotes.

## Usage
1. Install Rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone the repository.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/twine-solutions/grass-node.git
    cd grass-node
    ```
3. Run the project.
    ```sh
    cargo run --release -- --user-id <USER_ID> --proxies <PROXY_FILE>
    ```
